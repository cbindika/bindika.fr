# About this project

Here is how I built my **personal resume-website**:

This is a HTML/JS website designed for any free/cheap platform - I haven't used PHP or any other server side language on this project to make it lightweight and very portable.

In details, for this project I am using: ReactJs, Jquery (a set of modules that I will prune in a near future, in favor of more React magic). On the CSS side, Bootstrap glues my frontend together. I used a very light portofolio theme called "Dew" to start off.

The **coolest things** so far of this project:
- Timeline, based on [react-vertical-timeline](https://stephane-monnot.github.io/react-vertical-timeline)

## What's next?

- I am planning on making the stack more consistent by using more React.
- I will add a blog sections loading my posts in Ajax from Medium (and other platforms)
- A little section of what I like to do 
- I want to also add a section with my most significant projects (I am currently re-doing some of them in order to have it stored on Github)
- I will improve my page implementing the advises from PageSpeed Insights
